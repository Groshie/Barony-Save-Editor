# Barony-Save-Editor
A simple webapp for editing savegame-files that can be used for the game <a href="https://www.baronygame.com/">Barony</a>.
It's written in html and javascript, and uses Bootstrap 5 and AngularJS.

Basically, you input your save file into the app, edit values, and then export the new save file.

## What can it do?
<ul>
  <li>Change game information (dungeon level, game seed, map seed)</li>
  <li>Change general stats (name, gold, hunger, etc.)</li>
  <li>Change attributes (strength, agility, max hp etc.)</li>
  <li>Change proficiencies (swimming, blocking, sword, etc.)</li>
  <li>Toggle status effects or set timers for them (drunk, magic resist, strength, etc.)</li>
  <li>Add spells (but not remove them, yet)</li>
</ul>

## Disclaimers
Remember to back up (or simply don't replace) your original save file. I haven't found any problems, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a possibility to corrupt the save file depending on different combinations.

I am not affiliated with the game or developer of the game in any way, I just enjoy playing and testing - I hope that you will too!
